                      <p> Advance registration for most vintage dance classes is
                        NOT required; register and pay fee at first lesson.
                        Although you can register without a partner, we
                        recommend signing up as couples to promote gender
                        balance.</p>
                      <p> In most vintage dance classes, the instructor will ask
                        you frequently to change partners. There are several
                        reasons for this. People learn dance more quickly when
                        they dance with different partners, because each partner
                        will have different strengths and weaknesses. Changing
                        partners allows those who come without a partner to
                        dance wtih someone. Also, vintage dance manners
                        encourage dancing with different partners to be sociable
                        and assure that everyone has a good time. If you come
                        with a special partner and you really only want to dance
                        with that partner, please notify the instructor.</p>
                      <p> If you would like us to teach a particular type of
                        vintage dance in the future, please e-mail your request

In case a lesson has to be 						canceled due to bad weather or other emergency, the fifth session will be used as a						make-up lesson. The cost of the series is $35 per person, payable at the first						lesson. Students who miss the first lesson may join later with the consent of the						instructors, but the fee will still be $35.</p>					<p>						Included in the fee for the waltz series is a sixth session called <strong>Beyond Waltzing.</strong> 						This optional two-hour, mixed-level workshop will be an introduction to other types 						of vintage dance, such as polka, schottische, Ragtime tango or one-step, as well as time for open waltzing.  This session 						is also open to dancers not enrolled in the waltz series, at a cost of $7/person.</p>					<p>						<strong>Beyond the Basics</strong> will be organized similarly, except that dancers have the option of						paying $35 up front for the 6 sessions, or coming on a drop-in basis at $7/person per session.</p>                                <p>                                    Our waltz classes offer a very affordable way to learn traditional turning                                    waltz and modern cross-step waltz. This is the place to get started in waltzing                                    or to improve your waltzing skills and repertoire.</p>                                <p>                                    <strong>Waltz Basics</strong> is appropriate for those who have not done these types of waltzing                                    before or who want to develop their basic skills.

                                    <strong>Beyond the Basics</strong> focuses on building a repertoire of variations, musicality                                    and lead/follow skills.&nbsp; Prerequisite is the ability to do sustained turning                                    in both traditional and cross-step waltz.</p>                                <p>                                    The last 15 minutes or so of both classes will be reserved for free-style waltzing.                                    Students attending the 8:00 class may come for the waltzing at 7:45 if they wish.</p>                                <p>                                    The content of all classes will be customized to the students.
