        <h3> Jane Austen, 1775 - 1817</h3>
        <p>The balls in Austen's novel reflect a genteel and peaceful England of country estates and a leisure class. But change was in the air. In the 1810s, country dances and reels were giving way to new dances, including the quadrille from France, the mazurka from Russia, and the scandalous waltz. Political and diplomatic forces were poised to change the ballroom forever.</p>

        <h3>Dances to Music by Kentucky Composers 1835 - 1875</h3>
        <p>In the mid-1800s, Lexington was the Athens of the West and a lively center of culture. Kentucky composers wrote lively music for the latest dances:
            the waltz, polka, schottische and mazurka. Let us show you how these dances might have looked, hoop skirts and all!</p>

        <h3>The Gay Nineties</h3>
        <p>In the days before income taxes, wealthy families built extravagant mansions and lived high, while mainstream Americans were singing "Daisy Bell
            (Bicycle Built for Two)" and "Sweet Rosie O'Grady". This 30-minute program illustrates dances of the 1890s from around the world.</p>

        <h3>Downton Abbey Era - From the Titanic to the Twenties</h3>
        <p>From the class-bound elegance of the Edwardian Era through World War I to the exuberant chaos of the 1920s, the political and social life of England was changing fast. See how those changes were reflected in the social dances of the time.</p>
